## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Error**
   - Make sure you're using an app password, not your regular password
   - Verify 2-Factor Authentication is enabled
   - Check that your email and password are correct

2. **SMTP Connection Error**
   - Verify SMTP server and port settings
   - Check your internet connection
   - Some networks may block SMTP ports

3. **File Not Found Error**
   - Ensure `recipients.txt` exists and contains valid email addresses
   - Check that `files_to_send/` folder exists and contains files
   - Verify file permissions

4. **Large Attachment Error**
   - Check file sizes (most providers limit to 25MB total)
   - Consider using cloud storage links for large files

### Getting Help

Check the log file (`email_sender.log`) for detailed error messages. The script provides informative error messages to help diagnose issues.
